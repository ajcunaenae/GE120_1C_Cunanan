Procedural and Functional Programming are both essential ways to create and run code files. However, Procedural programming focuses more towards a
finite set of commands within the given program, and is generally considered simple. While Functional programming is responsible for performing 
more complex operations and functions, this also involves the user to input values.

Git allows for efficient means in collaborating when programming. It allows for its users to create programs, upload it to their site, and make
changes for as many times as one wants. It also makes the programming process interactive allowing different people to access, edit, or comment to
another user's work or code.

The difference between a while loop and a for loop is that, a while loop is used for values in which the total number of values is unknown or 
undefined, on the other hand, a for loop is used when the total number of values is certain. In the field of Geomatics, an example of this
can be defined as the values for distance and bearing in a traverse.

The Divide and Conquer paradigm in programming is a concept wherein one major problem can be divided into subsets of this problem (for example: 
Main Problem 1 ---> Sub-problem 1, Sub-problem 2, Sub-problem 3.) And these sub-problems have their own solutions or specific answers to 
those problems. In time, these solutions will have problems of their own, which results in the process of divide and conquering taking place, until
the whole problem is troubleshooted or fixed.

# Item no. 5
"""
Certain tasks in the field of geomatics can be optimized with the aid of programming. One example that comes to mind is creating waypoints in 
mapping. Although not as tedious as the process of traverse, leveling, or other processes, making a program to aid the user in map-making is
useful as it also deals with minimal to very big values. Similar to the traverse, this can also be achieved by implementing operations throughout 
code.
